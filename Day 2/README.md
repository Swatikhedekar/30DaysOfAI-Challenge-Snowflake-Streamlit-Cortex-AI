### 30 Days of AI – Streamlit × Snowflake Cortex

This project is part of the **#30DaysOfAI challenge**, designed to help you get started with building AI applications using **Streamlit** and **Snowflake Cortex**.

On **Day 2**, we run a Large Language Model (LLM) directly inside Snowflake using the `ai_complete()` function and display the response in a Streamlit app.

---

## 🧠 What You’ll Learn
- How to call an LLM using **Snowflake Cortex**
- How to send user prompts from Streamlit to Snowflake
- How to fetch and display AI responses
- How to run the same app in Snowflake, locally, or on Streamlit Cloud

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Streamlit  
- Snowflake Snowpark  
- Snowflake Cortex (LLMs)

---

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. User enters a prompt in the Streamlit app
2. Prompt is sent to a Cortex LLM using `ai_complete()`
3. Snowflake executes the model inference
4. The response is returned and displayed in the UI

---

## ▶️ Output
The app generates an AI response based on the user’s prompt and displays it instantly in Streamlit.
